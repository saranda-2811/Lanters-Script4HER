Problem Statement : 

1) Visibility - Due to lack of mobility and connectivity, often the rural women
entrepreneurs are forced to sell their produce/services within the local community and
therefore have very limited demand, seasonal demand and are not able to command the
best possible price. Design a solution which can enable them to make their service/product
visible and available to a wider audience.

2) Mentoring - Even once a rural woman sets up an enterprise, she needs constant
mentoring to overcome day to day business challenges as well as to keep herself
motivated. A mentor can also support to ensure that no other stakeholder is taking undue
advantage of her by squeezing margins or cutting corners. Design a solution to enable
mentor connect to rural women entrepreneurs and where do we get a pool of these
mentors who can connect, understand, appreciate challenges and provide non
judgemental inputs.
